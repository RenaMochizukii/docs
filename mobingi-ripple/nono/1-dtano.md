# 1. Notification of confirmation of billing data

You will receive an invoice from AWS between 3rd to 7th day of every month. When you receive the invoice, click the "`Report billing finalization`" button on the Ripple dashboard.

Within 2 business days, our support team\(ripple\_cs@mobingi.com\) send an e-mail with the title of `[Company name] x (month) Complete notification of billing data calculation request.` If you receive this email, please proceed to the next step.

If you would like to include a temporary fee in the bill that does not appear on your regular invoice, such as AWS support fee, AWS-provided credit, refund, etc., please click the " Report billing finalization" after 7th day of month.
