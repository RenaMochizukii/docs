# Invoice

Here, we introduce the functions of the "`Invoices`" section in the left menu.

## Create invoice

Create an invoice for each billing group.

## Recalculation billing data list

It shows RI prepayments, support charges, credits, refunds, etc.

If you make a mistake in the RI owner setting, or if you forgot to register the account you added on AWS, you need to request recalculation after setting and registering again.

There is no need to recalculate invoice settings such as fees and support charges, and you can create invoices immediately after changing the settings.

## Conversion rate setting

Set the monthly exchange rate required for billing.
