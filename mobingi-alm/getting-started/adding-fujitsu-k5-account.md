# Adding Fujitsu K5 account

Setting up Fujitsu K5 account on Mobingi ALM is different from AWS nor Alibaba Cloud. Instead of providing Access Key ID and Access Key Secret, you enter Fujitsu K5 username, password and contract number.

**Step 1**: Log into your Fujitsu K5 portal and find "User Management" section, create the user with necessary roles.
