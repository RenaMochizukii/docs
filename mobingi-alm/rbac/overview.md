# Overview

ALM supports Role Based Access Control \(**RBAC**\) to let you grant resource access to your user accounts.

* Role Based Access Control \(**RBAC**\) feature is shipped with **Mobingi Enterprise Edition**.
* RBAC feature helps you centralize activities and assign role based access control to all members in your organization. It allows you to securely control access to all resources for your users.

Using RBAC, you can segregate duties within your team and grant only the amount of access to users that they need to perform their jobs instead of giving everybody unrestricted permissions in your ALM console, you can allow only certain actions. For example, use RBAC to let one employee manage stack creation and update, while another can only view the stack resource\(s\).
