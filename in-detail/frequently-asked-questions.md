# Frequently asked Questions

## I forgot my user ID or password.

Please contact ripple\_cs@mobingi.com.

## Does the operation in Ripple affect the billing from AWS?

It does not affect. Ripple is a tool for breaking the blend rate and knowing the correct amount of usage, so operations with Ripple do not affect the charges from AWS or the AWS account that you manage.

## Please tell me about the handling of the Marketplace.

Although it is included in the invoice and CSV together with the monthly usage fee, some charges shown as "Recurring fee" will be displayed on the "Recalculation Request Data List" page as a lump sum.

## When do I need to recalculate?

Please check the following "recalculation request data list" item.

## Can I register multiple billing group IDs in one AWS account?

Customers can not register by themselves \(as of April 2019\).

Please contact ripple\_cs@mobingi.com if you would like to.
