# Change RI allocation

Mobingi Ripple automatically detects and displays the RI owned by the user.A notification will be displayed on the screen when a new RI is purchased.

Clicking on the notification takes you to the RI management screen.You can change the AWS account to attach by clicking `•••` &gt; Edit RI.

If you change the owner of RI, re-aggregate the data on Ripple side, and then issue an invoice, it will be calculated with the changed data. The owner of RI on AWS does not change.
