* Although there is no UI available yet, it is now possible to add IP whitelist or blacklist in Ripple. We will be providing a UI for this feature very soon but for the meantime, if you need to blacklist or whitelist IP addresses in Ripple, please contact us through our various contact channels.



  We accept IP entries in CIDR format \(i.e. `1.2.3.4/24`, `0.0.0.0/0`, or `5.6.7.8/32`\).[
